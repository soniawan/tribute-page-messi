          <h2>Here's a time line of Lionel Messi's life :</h2>

            <li>
              <span>24 June 1987</span> - Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in
              Rosario, Santa Fe, the third of four children of Jorge Messi and
              his wife Celia Cuccittini.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>30 March 1994</span> - A lifelong supporter of Newell's Old
              Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old.
              During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored 234 goals
              in 176 games (according to Rosario Football Association).
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>14 December 2000</span> - As the Messi family had relatives
              in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in
              September 2000. First team director Carles Rexach immediately
              wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the
              time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign
              players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was
              issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with
              no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>2 February 2002</span> - Messi enrolled at Barcelona's youth

              Hungary. Messi was sent off just one minute after he entered the

              best young player of the tournament, played in all 6 games having
              2 goals and 1 assist.
